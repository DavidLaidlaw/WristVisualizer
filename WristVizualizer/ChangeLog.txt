Version 1.3.2
- Feature: Distv has been ported, now runs.
- Fixed bug: In fullwrist mode, hitting hide-all or show-all would check bones that were disabled.

Version 1.3.1
- Fixed bug: MRIViewer can crash when trying to read pixels on bottom edge. Also, added additional text outputs for mouseover events.

Version 1.3.0
- Major re-write of main class, to move lots of ugly code into their own controller classes. There SHOULD be no major change to the end user.
- Fixed bug: Removed warning when loading filename that starts with a number
- Fixed bug: Corrected pixel identification in MRIViewer

Version 1.2.3
- Fixed bug. When loading new scene, force background to black.
- Fixed bug. Removed warning when loading filename with space in it.
- New Feature: MRIViewer. Pretty cool I say.

Version 1.2.2
- Fixed bug, so that when showing the scenegraph it tries to find the separator directly above, not starting with the second node

Version 1.2.1
- When loading an IV file, the filename is saved for the node name
- When viewing scenegraph, it will try and highlight the separator for the currently selected node, instead of defaulting to the root node

Version 1.2.0
- New: Added Texture functionality. Ability to load the stack file (based on the original neutral scan) onto the CT image from various sources.
